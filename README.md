# **Essence Greenery**

Essence Greenery advocate for food production, and agricultural practices in a sustainable way using climate change as a focal point and taking her concept and mandate from the sustainable development goals. The project is mainly my idea which is based on my farm project in Nigeria. One of the primary objectives of building the website is to attract foreigners to partner or invest with us to tackle food insecurity and malnutrition in the future while transitioning to lower-carbon emission economies. The site is for an educational purpose though it meant to be a B2B2C. In the future, the sites hope to have a platform that will enable any person to do online shopping of all major food groceries and will be delivered within 30 minutes across his/her neighborhoods” a neighborhood online food platform”.

# **UX**
The website is to advocate and show how the food systems could be used to make food available to people without harming the environment. The website is to attract investors especially those abroad, educational institutions who are interested in the food system and climate change to partner with us so that we can work together to fight food insecurity and climate change. The user also can see what we have started. We think an online presence will attract our likes and those who want to invest in Africa.

# **Deployment**

I made my project on GitHub and used GitPod's integrated development environment to write the codes.
To enable my project to be seen by others, I deployed it to GitHub Pages with the following processes:

1. Firstly, I created a repository inside of my GitHub account using the template given by the Code Institute.
2. Secondly, I launched the page i.e my work environment on Gitpod from the repository namely: **Rozdandy/myfirst-miletone-project** using Gitpod's Chrome extension that I have already installed in my system.
3. Intermittently, I pushed all relevant changes to the repository (**Rozdandy/myfirst-miletone-project**), from Gitpod regularly as I work daily.
4. When I finished the project, I opened the 'Settings' in the project repository in GitHub.
5. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
6. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch"
7. The page will automatically refresh.
8. This process deployed my project on GitHub Pages, that enables to share the live website to others.


**For other users, they need to:**

1. Log into GitHub.
2. choose the title repository of this project:**Rozdandy/myfirst-miletone-project**
3. In the menu click on settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
4. From the "Source" dropdown menu, they will need to choose "Master Branch" and click "Save"
5. A pop-up message "Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/Bootstrap/" will appear under Github Pages
6. The page will automatically be refreshed and the website would be deployed

### **Forking the GitHub Repository**

This means making a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and possibly make changes without impacting  the original repository through the following methods:

* Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
* At the top of the Repository just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
* This will generate a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

*How to clone / run this project locally*
