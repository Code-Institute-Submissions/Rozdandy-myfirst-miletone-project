# **Essence Greenery**

Essence Greenery advocate for food production, and agricultural practices in a sustainable way using the climate change as a focal point and taking her concept and mandate from the sustainable development goals. The project is mainly my idea which is based on my farm project in Nigeria. One of the primary objective of building the website is to attract foreigner to partner or invest with us in order to tackle food insecurity and malnutrition in the future while transitioning to lower-carbon emission economies.
The site is for educational purpose though it mant to be a B2B2C.
In the future, the sites hope to have a platform that will enable any person to do online shopping of all major food groceries and will be delivered within 30 minutes across his/her neighbourhoods  ”a neighbourhood online food platform”. 

# **UX**
The website is to advocate and show how the food systems could be used to make food available to people without harming the environment. The website is to attract investors especially those in abroad, educational institutions who are interested in the food system and climate change to partner with us so that we can work together to fight food insecurity and climate change. The user also be able to see what we have started. We think, an online presence will attract our likes and those who want to invest in Africa.
